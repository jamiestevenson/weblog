Added round ball and proper offset for ball as it is smaller than other elements.

Added helper to get CSS variables from app root element for use in canvas painting.

- The logica page component needs broken out to separate components.
- For example, the canvas should be one container.

Could move on to more game-loop and collision, or adding ngrx:

  - Inclined to get a level working first to inform the requirements for the store etc.
  - Also need to read around if ngrx is suitable for low-load game loop.
