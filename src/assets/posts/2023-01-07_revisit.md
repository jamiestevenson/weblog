## Revisit

After dosing some CPD / refresher on CSS and layouts, I revisited this project.

I found that it needed a bit of TLC:

 - Resolved most *dependabot* notificaitons
 - Updated versions on all the things 🎉
 - Updated some config/pathing issues that seem to have appeared since the updates
 - Reviewed other updates

 Now to do what I had actually planned:

 - Improve styling
 - Implement responsive layout
 - Play around with design a bit more
