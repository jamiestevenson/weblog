## Logica

Prior to adding another feature, taking another look at the `logica` module to see if it can be moved forward a bit.

- Fixed CS on control panel to make it 'stick' to the game board properly.
- Update board to refresh (remove old sprites) on redraw
- Redraw the board on 'tick'
- Balls now 'fall' on each tick
